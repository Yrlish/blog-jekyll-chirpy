Having been in the industry as a software engineer for over 9 years now, you realize that technology is constantly evolving and you will never know everything. What you learnt yesterday may no longer be relevant tomorrow. Well, I already knew this many years ago, maybe even before I actually started working.

I have always been a tinkerer regarding software in one way or another since I was 11 years old. Starting out with HTML, moving on with JavaScript and PHP, administrating game servers for Counter-Strike and Minecraft in gaming communities and playing lots of Garry's Mod and Minecraft (the alpha and beta days) through my youth among many more things. When I arrived to high school we finally got to have programming courses (finally!), which I had a upper hand in both because of my interest and my previous experience with tinkering (even if much of it was bad/wrong).

## Curiosity Fuels Growth

The software development industry is very fast-paced, making continuous learning essential. Programming languages, frameworks, and tools emerge regularly, and some can become irrelevant quite quickly. It is important to stay informed about industry trends, particularly those that align with your personal interests.

Allowing your curiosity explore will make you a better developer, widen your field of knowledge and maybe find more things to explore on the way.

Everyone on your team has unique niche interests, which allows you to complement one another. **Your tool belt is as important as your colleague's, and together you make a toolbox.** Therefore, you should definitely explore any interests that arise during your regular work routine.

## working header: Time for Exploring

Why should you learn and tinker in your spare time? In my opinion and experience, it should be driven by your own desire and genuine curiosity about the subjects you wish to explore further.

If exploring new technologies and tinkering with them does not come naturally to you, you should set aside specific periods each week as placeholders for when you are feeling adventurous. You should never force it so if you are not feeling it, simply skip it.
