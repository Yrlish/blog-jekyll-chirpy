Hi there!

I have refreshed this website from a [React-based app][react-app] to a statically generated [Jekyll-based][jekyll-app] one. At the same time I've created a new [about page][about] with more information than previously.

This new [Jekyll-based][jekyll-app] allows me to write posts about various things written in Markdown. Something which I have been thinking about doing for a while. Do not expect lots of posts or for them to appear often.

The content of these posts will most likely be posts about development and my homelab (services, networking, administrating, etc).
