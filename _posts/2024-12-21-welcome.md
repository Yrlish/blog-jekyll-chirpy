Hi there!

I’m excited to share that I’ve refreshed this website, transitioning from a [React-based app][react-app] to a statically generated [Jekyll site][jekyll-app]. Along with this change, I’ve created a new ["About" page][about] that offers more insight into who I am and what I do.

This new Jekyll setup allows me to write posts in Markdown, something I’ve been eager to do for a while. While you may not see a flood of posts, I plan to share my thoughts and experiences on various topics, primarily focusing on development and my homelab. Expect to find insights on services, networking, administration, and more.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find something here that resonates with you!
