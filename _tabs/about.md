Hi, I am Dennis Alexandersson, a passionate software engineer with a focus on backend systems. With over 9 years of experience, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and technologies, which have greatly enhanced my skills. Some of the languages and frameworks I work with include `Java`, `Java EE` / `Jakarta EE`, `Spring Boot` / `Quarkus` and `PostgreSQL`.

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with new technologies that I find interesting, which helps me stay creative and inspired.
